# Building Resources using the Azure Resource Manager

### Exercise 1: Signing in to the Azure Portal

1. Log into the **Azure Portal**.

    >Note: The lab platform will give you a username and password that you can use to sign-in to the Azure Portal. Please use this username and password for the labs instead of your own company-supplied username and password.

1. In the top center of the **Home** view, select **Dashboard** as your default view and click **Save**.

1. In the navigation pane on the left side, click **Dashboard**.

### Exercise 2: View Resource Groups

#### Task 2: View a Resource Group using the Cloud Shell and Azure CLI

1.  At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is a symbol that is constructed of the combination of the *greater than* and *underscore* characters.

1.  Because this is your first time opening the **Cloud Shell** using your *Azure Pass* subscription, you will see a wizard to configure **Cloud Shell** for first-time usage. Perform the following actions:

    a.  When offered a choice between **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select the **Bash** option.

    b.  You will then see a dialog prompting you to create a new **Storage Account** to begin using the shell. You can safely accept the default settings and click the **Create storage** button.

    c.  Wait for the **Cloud Shell** to finish its first-time setup procedures before moving on with the lab.

    > If you do not see the configuration options for **Cloud Shell**, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written from the perspective that you are using a new Azure Pass subscription. You may see some small discrepancies in future lab instructions.

1.  In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press **Enter** to view a list of possible CLI commands:

    ```azurecli-interactive
        az --help
    ```

1.  Type in the following command and press **Enter** to view a list of possible CLI commands for *Resource Groups*:

    ```azurecli-interactive
        az group --help
    ```

1.  Type in the following command and press **Enter** to view a list of possible CLI commands to *list Resource Groups*:

    ```azurecli-interactive
        az group list --help
    ```

1.  Type in the following command and press **Enter** to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```azurecli-interactive
        az group list
    ```

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** prompt at the bottom of the portal.

### Exercise 3: Deploy a Minimal Template

            "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
            "resources": [
                {

                    "name": "[concat('stor', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]",
                    "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
                    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
                    "properties": {
                        "accountType": "Standard_LRS"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ```
